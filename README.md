# 🐦 Django-Microblog

Full-featured microblogging app built with Django, DRF, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL.  
JWT-based authentication, user profiles, image uploads, and a modern single-page frontend — all deployed and Dockerized.

This project was built to deepen my understanding of Django in a multi-app architecture and explore topics like signals, advanced testing, and full-stack deployment.
